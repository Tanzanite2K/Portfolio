# Portfolio 
This is a fully responsive portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. The site is designed with a modern UI/UX approach, highlighting my journey as a developer, the technologies I work with, and the projects I’ve built. It includes sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, Contact Form, and Resume download. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React), this portfolio serves as my personal brand and digital resume, aimed at potential employers and collaborators.
